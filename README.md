# service-call-least-distance
Here's a Python program that uses the Google OR-Tools library to solve the assignment problem and find the least amount of travel for your service employees given their starting positions and service calls for the day.

You can modify the starting_positions, service_calls, and assigned_slots dictionaries to reflect your specific data. The program will output the total travel distance and the optimal assignments of employees to service calls.
